Using a WinGet Configuration file, you can consolidate manual machine setup and project onboarding to a single command that is reliable and repeatable.
To achieve this, WinGet utilizes:

    A YAML-formatted WinGet Configuration file that lists all of the software versions, packages, tools, dependencies, and settings required to set up the desired state of the development environment on your Windows machine.
    PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) to automate the configuration of your Windows operating system.
    The Windows Package Manager winget configure command to initiate the configuration process.

The configure command of the winget tool uses a WinGet Configuration file to begin setting up your Windows machine to a desired development environment state.
WinGet Configuration is currently in preview.
To use a WinGet Configuration file with the winget configure command, you must first enable the experimental configuration feature.

Enable the WinGet Configuration experimental configuration preview feature
In order to use a WinGet Configuration file with the winget configure command:
    Confirm you're running the Preview version of WinGet.
    Enter the command: winget features to display a list of available experimental features.
    Enter the command: winget settings to open the WinGet Settings file in your default text editor. The WinGet Settings file uses a JSON format.

In your WinGet Settings JSON file, enter:

"experimentalFeatures": {
       "configuration": true
   }

Features may be managed by your workplace group policy, potentially blocking your ability to use experimental features.
You can use the winget --info command to view any policies in effect on your system.
